       "\" The following is a conversation with Jeff Basel's founder of Amazon and Blue Origin. This is his first time doing a conversation with this kind and of this length. And as he told me, it felt like we could have easily talked from many more hours, and I'm sure we will. This is the Lex3ment podcast, and now, dear friends, here's Jeff Basel's. You spent a lot of your childhood with your grandfather on a ranch here in Texas. And I heard you had a lot of work to do around the ranch. So what's the coolest job you're ever doing there? Wow, coolest, most interesting. Most memorable. Most, it was a, it was a, it was a real, it's a real working ranch. My, and I, I spent all my summers on that ranch from age four to 16. And my grandfather was really taking me those in the summers, and in the early summers, he was letting me pretend to help on the ranch. Because of course, the four year old is a burden not to help in real life. You're going to really just watching me and taking care of me. He was doing that because my mom was so young. She had me when she was 17. And so he was sort of given her a break and my grandmother and my grandfather would take me for these summers. But it's a little old ranch. It was helpful on the ranch. And I loved it. I was out there. Like, my grandfather had a huge influence on me, huge factor in my life. I did all the jobs you would do on a ranch. I've fixed windmills and laid fences and pipelines and, you know, done all the things that any rancher would do, vaccinated the animals, everything. But we had a, you know, my grandfather, after my grandmother, they're died. I was about 12. And I kept coming to the ranch. So it was then it was just him and me just the two of us. And he was completely addicted to the soap opera, the days of our lives. And we would go back to the ranch house every day around 1 pm or so to watch days of our lives and like sand's through an hourglass. So are the days of our lives? Just the image of that. The two of us. Watchy is a little pop up here. These are big crazy dogs. It was really a very formative experience. But the key thing about it for me, the great gift I got from it, was that my grandfather was so resourceful. You know, he did everything himself. He made his own veterinarials. He would make needles to suture the cattle up with it. He would find a little piece of wire and heat it up and pound it then and drill a hole in it and sharpen it. So, you know, you learn different things on a ranch than you would learn, you know, growing up in a city. So self-reliance. Yeah, like figure out that you can solve problems with enough persistence and ingenuity and a grandfather bought a D6 bulldozer, which is a big bulldozer. And he got it for like $5,000 because it was completely broken down. It was like a 1955 caterpillar D6 bulldozer knew it would have cost, I don't know, more than $100,000. And we spent an entire summer fixing the preparing that bulldozer. We used mill order to buy big gears for the transmission and they just opened it. We'd have to build a crane. You know, just that kind of kind of that problem solving mentality, he had it so powerfully. He did all of his own. He just he didn't pick up the phone and call somebody. He would figure it out on his own. He doing his own veterinary work, you know, which is the image of the two you're fixing a D6 bulldozer and then going in for a little break and one can do it. So popular. Laying on the floor. That's how he watched TV. Yeah, he was a really, really remarkable guy. That's how I imagine Clint Eastwood also. You know, all those westerns when he's when he's not doing what he's doing, he's just watching soap operas. All right. I read that you fell in love with the idea of space and space exploration when you were five or watching you learn strong walking on the moon. So let me ask you to look back at the historical context and impact of that. So the space race from 1957 to 1969 between the Soviet Union and the US was in many ways epic. It was a rapid sequence of dramatic events. For satellite to space for a human to space for a space walk first on code landing on the moon, then some failures, explosions, death sample size actually and then the first human walking on the moon. What are some of the more inspiring moments or insights you take away from that time? Those few years at just 12 years. Well, I mean, there's so much inspiring there. You know, one of the great things to take away from that. One of the great vod brown quotes is I have come to use the word impossible with great caution. Yeah. Yeah. And so that's kind of the big story of Apollo is that things, you know, going to the moon was literally an analogy that people used for something that's impossible. You know, oh, yeah, you'll do that when you know, men walk on the moon. Yeah. And of course, it finally happened. So, you know, I think it was pulled forward in time because of the space race. I think, you know, with the geopolitical implications and, you know, how much resource was put into it. You know, at the peak that program was spending, you know, two or three percent of GDP on the Apollo program, so much resource. I think it was pulled forward in time. You know, we kind of did it ahead of when we quote unquote, should have done it. Yeah. And so in that way, it's also a tactical marvel. I mean, it's truly incredible. It's, you know, it's the 20th century version of building the pyramids or something. It's, you know, it's an achievement that because it was pulled forward in time, it because it did something that had previously been thought impossible. It rightly deserves its place as, you know, in the Pantheon of great human achievements. And of course, you named the projects, the rockets that Blue Origin is working on after some of the folks involved. Yeah. I don't understand why I didn't say new Gagarin. Is that American bias in the naming? I apologize. Very strange. That's a very strange. That's a very strange. That's a very big fan of Gagarin's though. And in fact, I, I think his, his first words in space, I think are incredible. He, you know, he, purportedly said, my God, it's blue. And that really drives home. No one had seen the earth from space. No one knew that we were on this blue planet. Yeah. No one knew what it looked like from out there. And Gagarin was the first person to see it. One of the things I think about is how dangerous those early days were for Gagarin, for for Gland, for everybody involved, like how big of a risk of all they were taking huge risks. I'm not sure what the Soviets thought about Gagarin's flight. But I think that the Americans thought that the Allen Shepherd flight, the flight that, you know, new Shepherd is named after the first American in space. He went on his suborbital flight. They thought he had about a 75% chance of success. So, you know, that's a pretty big risk, a 25% It's kind of interesting that Allen Shepherd is not quite as famous as John Glenn. So, if we'll be able to know, Allen Shepherd is the first astronaut. The first American in space. American in suborbital flight. Correct. And then the first orbital flight is John Glenn is the first American to orbit the earth. By the way, I have the most charming, sweet, incredible letter from John Glenn, which I have framed and hang on my office wall. Where he tells me how grateful he is that we have named new Glenn after him. And it sent me that letter about a week before he died. And it's really incredible. It's also a very funny letter. He's writing and he says, you know, this is a letter about new Glenn from the original Glenn. And he's just kind of great since a few more. And he's very, he's very happy about it and great faults. Very sweet. Does he say P.S. don't mess this up or is it? No, he does it. Making you look good. It doesn't do that. Okay. But John, wherever you are, we got your car. Yeah. Good. So, so back to maybe the big picture of space. When you look up at the stars and think big, what do you hope is the future of humanity? Hundreds, thousands of years from now out in space. I would love to see, you know, a trillion humans living in the solar system. If we had a trillion humans, we would have it any given time, a thousand Mozart and a thousand nine stines. That would be our solar system before life and intelligence and energy. And we can easily support a civilization that large with all of the resources in the solar system. So, what do you think that looks like? Giant space stations? Yeah. The only way to get to that vision is with giant space stations. You know, the planetary surfaces are just way too small. So, you can, I mean, unless you turn them into giant space stations or something. But, but yeah, we will take materials from the moon and from near earth objects and from the asteroid belt and so on. And we'll build giant oeniel style colonies and people will live in those. And there have a lot of advantages over planetary surfaces. You can spend them to get normal earth gravity. You can put them where you want them. I think most people are going to want to live near earth, not necessarily in earth orbit, but in, you know, earth, but near earth vicinity orbits. And so, they can move, you know, relatively quickly, back and forth between their station and earth. So, but I think a lot of people, especially in the early stages, are not going to want to give up earth altogether. They go to earth provocation. Yeah. Same way that, you know, you might go to to Yellowstone National Park for Vacation. People will, and people will get to choose where they live on earth or they live in space, but they'll be able to use much more energy and much more material resource in space, so they would be able to use on earth. One interesting idea is you had is to move the heavy industry away from earth. So, people sometimes have this idea that somehow space exploration is in conflict with the celebration of the planet earth that we should focus on preserving earth and basically your ideas that space travel space exploration is the way to preserve earth. Exactly. This planet, we've sent robotic probes to all the planets. We know that this is the good one. Not the play favorites. The earth really is the good planet. It's an amazing, the ecosystem we have, you're all of the life and the lush plant life and, you know, the water resources, everything this planet is really extraordinary. And of course, we evolved on this planet. So of course, it's perfect for us, but it's also perfect for all the advanced life forms on this planet, all the animals and so on. And so this is a gem we do need to take care of it. And as we enter the Anthropocene, as we get, as we humans have gotten so sophisticated and large and impactful as we try to cross this planet, you know, that is going to, as we continue, we want to use a lot of energy. We want to use a lot of energy per capita. We've gotten amazing things. We don't want to go backwards. You know, if you think about the good old days, they're mostly in illusion. Like in almost every way, life is better for almost everyone today. Then it was, say, 50 years ago or 100 years ago, we live better lives by and large than our grandparents did and their grandparents did and so on. And you can see that in global, literacy rates, global poverty rates, global infant mortality rates, like almost any metric you choose were better off than we used to be. And antibiotics and all kinds of life-saving medical care and so on and so on. And there's one thing that is moving backwards and it's the natural world. So it is a fact that 500 years ago pre-industrial age, the natural world was pristine. It was incredible. And we have traded some of that pristine beauty for all of these other gifts that we have as an advanced society. And we can have both. But to do that, we have to go to space. And all of this really, the most fundamental measure is energy usage per capita. And when you look at, you know, you do want to continue to use more and more energy. It is going to make your life better in so many ways. But that's not compatible ultimately with living on a finite planet. And so we have to go out into the source system. And really, you could argue about when you have to do that. But you can't credibly argue about whether you have to do that. Yeah, eventually we have to do that. Exactly. So you don't often talk about it, but let me ask you on that topic about the blue ring and the Orbital Reef space infrastructure projects. What's your vision for these? So blue ring is a very interesting spacecraft that is designed to take up to 3,000 kilograms of payload up to just synchronous orbit or in lunar vicinity. It has two different kinds of propulsion. It has chemical propulsion and it has electric propulsion. And so it can, you can use blue ring in a couple different ways. You can slowly move, let's say, up to geosynchronous orbit using electric propulsion that might take, you know, 100 days or 150 days depending on how much mass you're carrying. And then, and reserve your chemical propulsion so that you can change orbit's quickly in geosynchronous orbit. Or you can use the chemical propulsion first to quickly get up to geosynchronous and then use your electrical propulsion to slowly change your geosynchronous orbit. Blue ring has a a couple of interesting features. It provides a lot of services to these payloads. So the payload, it could be one large payload or it can be a number of small payloads. And it provides thermal management, it provides electric power, it provides compute provides communications. And so when you design a payload for blue ring, you don't have to figure out all of those things on your own. So kind of radiation tolerant compute is a complicated thing to do. And so we have an unusually large amount of radiation tolerant compute on board blue ring and you can, your payload can just use that what it needs to. So it's sort of all these services. It's like a set of APIs. It's a little bit like Amazon web services but for space payloads, they need to move about an earth vicinity or lunar facility. A, W, SS. Okay, so compute and space. So you get a giant chemical rocket to get a payload out of orbit and then you have these admins that show up this blue ring, thing that manages various things like compute. Exactly. And it can also provide transportation and move you around to different orbits. Including humans? You think so? No. But blue ring is not designed to move humans around. It's designed to move payloads around. So we're also building a lunar lander which is a course designed to land humans on the surface of the moon. I want to ask you about that. Well, let me actually just step back to the old days. You were at Princeton with aspirations to be a theoretical physicist. Yeah. What attracted you to physics and why did you change your mind and not become? Why, why you're not Jeff Bezos the famous theoretical physicist? So I loved physics and I said physics and computer science and I was proceeding along the physics path I was playing to major in physics and I wanted to be a theoretical physicist and I, and the computer science was sort of something I was doing for fun. I really loved it. And I was very good at the programming and doing those things and I enjoyed all my computer science classes immensely. But I really was determined to be a theoretical physicist. I, why went to Princeton the first place it was definitely. And then I realized I was going to be a mediocre theoretical physicist. And there were, there were a few people in my classes like in quantum mechanics and so on who they could effortlessly do things were so difficult for me. And I realized like, you know, there are a thousand ways to be smart. And to be a really, you know, theoretical physics is not one of those fields where the, you know, only the top few percent actually move the state of the art forward. It's one of the things where you have to be really just, you were brain has to be wired in a certain way. And there was a guy named, um, one of these people who was convinced me, he didn't mean to convince me, which just by observing him, he convinced me that I should not try to be a theoretical physicist. His name was Yosanta. And Yosanta was from Sri Lanka. And he's, he was one of the most brilliant people I'd ever met. My friend, Joe and I were working on a very difficult partial differential equations, problem set one night. And there was one problem that we worked on for three hours. And we made no headway whatsoever. And we looked up at each other at the same time and we said, Yosanta. So we went to Yosanta's dorm room. Yeah. And he was there. He was almost always there. And we said Yosanta, we're having trouble solving this partial differential equation, which mind taking a look. And he said, of course, by the way, he was the most humble, most kind person. And so he took our, he looked at our problem. And he stared at it for just a few seconds, maybe 10 seconds. And he said, cosine. And I said, what do you mean Yosanta? What do you mean cosine? He said, that's the answer. And I said, no, no, come on. And he said, let me show you, you need to took out some paper. And you wrote down three pages of equations. Everything canceled out. And the answer was cosine. And I said, Yosanta, did you do that in your head? And he said, no, no, that would be impossible. A few years ago, I solved a similar problem. And I could map this problem onto that problem. And then it was immediately obvious that the answer was cosine. I had a few, you know, you haven't experienced like that. You realize maybe being a theoretical physicist. Isn't your, isn't what you're, you're, you're, the, what the universe wants you to be. And so, I switched to computer science and, and, you know, that worked out really well for me. I enjoyed it. I still enjoyed it today. Yeah, there's a particular kind of intuition. You need to be a great physicist in applied to physics. I think the mathematical skill required today is so high. You have to be a world-class mathematician to be a successful theoretical physicist today. And it's not, you know, it, you probably need other skills to intuition, lateral thinking, and so on. But without the, without, just top-notch math skills, you're unlikely to be successful. And visualization skill, you have to be able to really kind of do these kind of thought experiments. And if you want to truly great creativity, actually, watch our physics on the right to about you, put you on the same level as Einstein. Well, and he's, that's a very kind. I have, I have an inventor. If you, if you want to boil down what I am, I'm really an inventor. And I look at things and I can come up with a typical solutions. And, you know, and then I can create a hundred such a typical solutions for something. And 99 or them may not survive, you know, scrutiny. But one of those 100 is like, hmm, maybe there is, maybe that might work. And then you can keep going from there. So that kind of lateral thinking, that kind of inventiveness. In a high-dimensionality space where the search space is very large, that's where my inventive skills come. That's the thing I'm, if I self-identify as an inventor, more than anything else. Yeah. And he describes in all kinds of different ways. Walter Eisen does that creativity combined with childlike, a wander that you've maintained still to this day. All of that combined together. Is there, like, a few words of study on brain introspect? How do you think? What's your thinking process? Like, we'll talk about the writing process of putting it down on paper, which is quite rigorous and famous at Amazon. But how do you when you sit down? Maybe alone, maybe with others, and thinking through this high-dimensional space, and looking for creative solutions, creative paths forward. Is there something you could say about that process? It's such a good question. And I honestly don't know how it works. If I did, I would try to explain it. I know it involves lots of wandering. So, when I sit down to work on a problem, I know I don't know where I'm going. So to go in a straight line, to be efficient, efficiency and invention are sort of at odds because invention real invention, not incremental improvement. Incoming improvement is so important. And every endeavor and everything you do, you have to work hard on it, also just making things a little bit better. But I'm talking about real invention, real lateral thinking. That requires wandering. And you have to give yourself permission to wander. I think a lot of people, they feel like wandering is inefficient and should, you know, like when when I sit down at a meeting, I don't know how long the meeting is going to take if we're trying to solve a problem. Because if I did, then I'd already, I'd know there's some kind of straight line that we're drawing to the solution. The reality is, we may have to wander for a long time. And I do like group invention. I think there's really nothing more fun than sitting at a whiteboard with a group of smart people and spit balling and coming up with new ideas and objections to those ideas and then solutions to the objections and going back and forth. So, like, you know, sometimes you wake up with an idea and the middle of the night and sometimes you sit down with a group of people and go back and forth. And both things are really pleasurable. And when you wander, I think one key thing is to notice a good idea. And to maybe to notice the kernel of a good idea, let me be pull it that string because I don't think a good idea has come fully formed. 100% right. In fact, when I come up with what I think is a good idea and it survives kind of the first level of scrutiny, you know, that I do at my own head. And I'm ready to tell somebody else about the idea. I will often say, look, it is going to be really easy for you to find rejections to this idea. But work with me. There's something there. There's something there. And that is intuition. Because it's really easy to kill new ideas in the beginning because they do have so many so many easy objections to them. So you need to kind of forewarn people and say, look, I know it's going to take a lot of work to get this to a fully formed idea. Let's get started on that. It will be fun. So you got that ability to say cosine and use somewhere and after all. Maybe not on math. In a different domain. There are a thousand ways to be smart by the way. And that is a really like when I go around, you know, and I meet people, I'm always looking for the way that they're smart. And you find it is, that's one of the things that makes the world so interesting and fun is that it's not like IQ is a single dimension. There are people who are smart and such unique ways. Yeah, you just gave me a good response. Does somebody calls me an idiot on the internet? You know, that's a thousand ways to be smart. They might tell you, yeah, but they're a million to be ways to be done. Yeah. I feel like that's a Mark Twinkle. Okay. All right. You gave me an amazing tour of Blue Origin rocket factory in launch complex in the historic Cape Canaveral. That's where New Glenn, the big rocket we talked about as being built and we'll launch. Can you explain what the New Glenn rocket is and tell me some interesting technical aspects of how it works. Sure. New Glenn is a very large heavy lift launch vehicle to take about 45 metric tons to Leo, very a very large class. It's about half the thrust a little more than half the thrust of the Saturn 5 rockets. So it's about 3.9 million pounds of thrust on lift off. The booster has 7 BE4 engines. The each engine generates a little more than 550,000 pounds of thrust. The engines are fueled by liquid natural gas, liquid-fight natural gas, LNG, as the fuel and locks as the oxidizer. The cycle is an oxygen-roached stage combustion cycle. It's a cycle that was really pioneered by the Russians. It's a very good cycle. And that engine is also going to power the first stage of the Vulcan rocket, which is the 9-log alliance rocket. Then the second stage of New Glenn is powered by two BE3U engines, which is a upper stage variant of our new shepherd liquid hydrogen. So the BE3U has 160,000 pounds of thrust. So two of those 320,000 pounds of thrust. Hydrogen is a very good propellant for upper stages because it has very high ISP. It's not a great propellant in my view for booster stages because the stages then get physically so large. Hydrogen has very high ISP, but liquid-hiredgen is very not dense at all. So to store liquid hydrogen, you know, if you need to store many thousands of pounds of liquid hydrogen, your tanks, your liquid-hiredgen tank, it's very large. So you really get more benefit from the higher ISP, the specific impulse. You get more benefit from the higher specific impulse on the second stage. And that stage carries less propellant so you don't get such geometrically gigantic tanks. The Delta 4 is an example of a vehicle that is all hydrogen. The booster stage is also hydrogen. And I think that it's a very effective vehicle, but it never was very cost effective. So it's operationally very capable but not very cost effective. Besides it's also costly. Besides it's costly. So it's interesting. Rockets love to be big. Everything works better. What do you mean by that? You've told me that before. It sounds epic. I mean when you look at the kind of the physics of rocket engines and also when you look at parasitic mass. It does it if you have let's say you have an avionic system so you have a guidance and control system. That is going to be about the same mass and size for a giant rocket as it is going to be for a tiny rocket. And so that's just parasitic mass that is very consequential if you're building a very small rocket. But it's trivial if you're building a very large rocket. So you have the parasitic mass thing. And then if you look at for example rocket engines have turbo pumps. They have to pressurize the fuel and the oxidizer up to a very high pressure level in order to inject it into the thrust chamber where it burns. And those pumps all rotating machines in fact get more efficient as they get larger. So really tiny turbo pumps are very challenging to manufacture. And any kind of gaps you know are between the housing for example and the rotating impeller that pressurizes the fuel. There has to be some gap there. You can have those parts scraping against one another. And those gaps drive inefficiencies. And so you know if you have a very large turbo pump those gaps and percentage terms in it being very small. And so there's a bunch of things that you end up loving about having a large rocket and that you end up hating for a small rocket. But there's a giant exception to this rule and it is manufacturing. So manufacturing large structures is very very challenging as a pain in the butt. And so you know it's just you know if you're making a small rocket engine you can move all the pieces by hand you could assemble it on a table. One person can do it you know you don't need cranes and heavy lift operations and tooling and so on and so on. When you start building big objects, infrastructure, civil infrastructure just like the launch pad and the you know all the we we went and visited it and took you to the launch pad and you can see it's so monumental. And so just these things become major undertakings both from an engineering point of view but also from a construction and cost point of view. And even the the foundation of the launch pad. I mean this is Florida like isn't like swamp land like how deep you have to go. Cape Canaveral. In fact, it's most ocean you know most launch pads are on beaches everywhere on the oceans like because you want to launch over water for safety reasons. The yes you have to drive pilings you know dozens and dozens and dozens of pilings you know 50 150 feet deep to get enough structural integrity for these very large you know it's it's yes these turned into major civil engineering projects. I said to say everything about that factory is pretty bad as he said tooling the bigger he gets the more epic it is. It does make it epic. It's fun to look at. It's extraordinary. It's humbling also because the humans are so small compared to it. We are building these enormous machines that are harnessing enormous amounts of chemical power you know in very very compact packages it's truly extraordinary. But then there's all the different components and you know the materials involved. Is there something interesting that you can describe about the materials that's comprised of the rocket so it has to be as light as possible I guess whilst with standing the heat into the harsh conditions. Yeah I play a little kind of game sometimes with other rocket people that I run into where they what are the things that would amaze the 1960s engineers. Like what what's changed because surprisingly some of rocket trees greatest hits have not changed. They are still they would recognize immediately a lot of what we do today and it's exactly what they pioneered back in the 60s. But a few things have changed you know the use of carbon composites is is very different today you know we can build various sophisticated you saw our carbon tape laying machine the builds the giant bearings and we can build these incredibly light very stiff fairing structures out of carbon composite material that they could not have dreamed of. I mean the efficiency the structural efficiency of that material is so high compared to any you know metallic material you might use or anything else. So that's one aluminum lithium and the ability to friction stir weld aluminum lithium. Remember if the friction is welding that I should do this is a remarkable technology this invented decades ago but has become very practical over the just the last couple of decades and instead of using heat to weld two pieces of metal together it literally stirs the two pieces. There's a pin that rotates at a certain rate and you put that pin between the two plates of metal that you want to weld together and then you move it at a very precise speed and instead of heating the material it heats it a little bit because of friction but not very much. You can literally immediately after welding with stir friction welding you can touch the material and it's just barely warm. It literally stirs the molecules together it's quite extraordinary. Relatively low temperature and I guess high temperatures will make the that's the that makes it a weak point exactly so with traditional welding techniques you may have whatever the underlying strength characteristics of the material are you end up with weak regions where you weld and with friction stir welding the welds are just as strong as the bulk material so it really allows you and so because when you're you know let's see your building a tank that you're going to press rise you know a large you know liquid natural gas tank for for a booster stage for example you know if you are well to know traditional methods you have to size those weld lands the thickness of those pieces with that knock down for whatever damage you're doing with the weld and that's going to add a lot of weight to that tank. I mean even just looking at the ferings the result of that the the complex shape that it takes and yeah and like what it's supposed to do is kind of incredible because people don't know it's on top of the rocket it's going to fall apart. That's it's task but it has to stay strong sometimes yes and then disappear what it needs to. That's right just a very difficult task. Yes when you need something that needs to have 100% integrity and tell it needs to have 0% integrity needs to stay attached until it's ready to go away and then when it goes away it has to go away completely. You use explosive charges for that and so it's a very robust way of separating structure when you need to explode. Yeah it was a little tiny bits of explosive material and it just it will sever the whole connection. So if you want to go from 100% structural integrity to 0 as fast as possible it's explosive. Use explosives. The idea of this thing is so bad as okay so we're back to the two stages so the first stages reusable. Yeah second stage is expendable second stage is liquid hydrogen liquid oxygen so we get take advantage of the higher specific impulse. The first stage lands down range on a landing platform in the ocean comes back for maintenance and get ready to do the next mission. I mean there's a million questions but also is there a path to as reusability for the second stage? There is and we know how to do that right now we're going to work on manufacturing that second stage to make it as inexpensive as possible. Sort of two paths for a second stage. Make it reusable or work really hard to make it inexpensive so you can afford to expend it and that trade is actually not obvious which one is better. Even in terms of class even like time. I'm talking about cost. Space flight getting into orbit is a solve problem we solved it back in the 50s and 60s and making it sound like. The only thing that the only interesting problem is dramatically reducing the cost of access to orbit which is if you can do that you open up a bunch of new endeavors that lots of startup companies that we're also going to do. So that's we really our mission is to be part of this industry and lower the cost to orbit so that there can be kind of a renaissance, a golden age of people to all kinds of interesting things in space. I like how you said getting to orbit is a solve problem. It's just the only interesting things you're reducing the cost. You know you can describe every single problem facing human civilization that exists is what's say everything is a solved problem. We've solved everything the rest is just what is the reference that that's just damn collecting. There's just a detailed some of the greatest innovations and inventions and you know brilliance is in that cost reduction stage right and you've had a long career of cost reduction. For sure and you know when you what is cost reduction really mean it means inventing a better way. Yeah exactly. Right and when you invent a better way you make the whole world richer. So you know whatever it was I don't know how many thousands of years ago somebody invented the plow and when they invented the plow they made the whole world richer because they made farming less expensive. And so it is a big deal to invent better ways that's how the world gets richer. So what are some of the biggest challenges on the manufacturing side and the engineering side that you're facing in working to get to the first launch of new glider? The first launch is one thing and we'll do that in 2024 coming up in this coming year. The real thing that's the bigger challenge is making sure that our factory is efficiently manufacturing at rate. So rate production. So consider if you want to launch new glider in you know 24 times a year. You need to manufacture a upper stage since they're expendable every you know twice a month you need to do whatever two weeks. So you need to be you need to have all of your manufacturing facilities and processes and inspection techniques and acceptance tests and everything operating at rate and rate manufacturing is at least as difficult as designing the vehicle in the first place and the same thing. So every upper stage has two B E 3 U engines. So those engines you know you need if you're going to launch the vehicle twice a month you need four engines a month so you need an engine every week. So you need to be that engine needs to be being produced at rate and that's a and there's all of the things that you need to do that all the right machine tools all the right fixtures the right people process etc. So it's one thing to build a first article right so that's you know to launch new glider for the first time you need to produce a first article but that's not the hard part the hard part is everything that's going on behind the scenes to build a factory that can produce new glids at rate. So the first one is produced in a way that's enables the production of the second and third and the fourth and the fifth and second. You can think of the first article as kind of pushing it it pushes all of the rate manufacturing technology along you know in other words it's kind of the you know it's the test article in a way that's testing out your manufacturing technologies. The manufacturing is the big challenge. Yes I mean I don't want to make it sound like any of it is easy I mean the people who are designing the engines and all this like all of it is hard for sure but the but the challenge right now is driving really hard to get to get to rate manufacturing to do that in an efficient way again kind of back to our cost point. If you get to rate manufacturing in an inefficient way you haven't really solved the cost problem and maybe you haven't really moved the state of the art forward all this has to be about moving the state of the art forward. There are easier, easier businesses to do I always tell people look if you are trying to make money you know we started salty snack food company or something you know you you right that I did. I think make the Lex Friedman potato chips you know this doesn't don't say it the people want to steal it. Yeah it's hard to see what I'm saying it's like there's nothing easy about this business and but but it's its own reward it's it's it's it's it's fascinating it's worth while it's meaningful and so you know I you know not I don't want to pick on salty snack food companies but I think it's it's less meaningful you know at the end of the day you're not going to you're you're not going to have accomplished something amazing yeah there's even if you do make a lot of money out of yeah there's something fundamentally different about the the clinical business of space exploration yeah it's a first sure it's a grand project of humanity yes it's one of humanity's grand challenges and especially as you look at going to the moon and going to Mars and building giant onial colonies and unlocking all the things you know I won't live long enough to see the fruits of this but the fruits of this come from building a road to space getting the infrastructure I give you an analogy when I started Amazon I didn't have to develop a payment system it already existed it was called the credit card I didn't have to develop a transportation system to deliver the packages it already existed it was called the postal service and royal mail and Deutsche Post and so it's so all this heavy lifting infrastructure was already in place and I could stand on its shoulders and that's why when you look at the internet you know by the way another giant piece of infrastructure that was around in the early and taking you back to like 1994 people were using dial-up modems and it was piggybacking on top of the long distance phone network that's how the internet that's you know how people were accessing servers and so on and again if that hadn't existed it would have hundreds of billions of capex to put that out there no startup company could have done that and so the problem you know you see if you look at the dynamism in the internet space over the last 20 years it's because you know you see like two kids in a dorm room could start internet company that could be successful and do amazing things because they didn't have to build have infrastructure was already there and that's what I want to do I take you know my Amazon winnings and use that to build heavy infrastructure so the next generation you know the generation that's my children and their children you know those generations can then use that heavy infrastructure then there'll be space entrepreneurs who start in their dorm room yeah like that that will be a marker of success when you can have a really valuable space company started in a dorm room then we know that we've built enough infrastructure so the ingenuity and imagination can really be unleashed I find that very exciting as they will of course this kids do take all of this hard infrastructure building for granted of course that's not your perneural spirit that's a inventor's greatest dream is that their inventions are so successful that there are one day taken for granted you know nobody thinks of Amazon as an invention anymore nobody thinks of customer of users and we're pioneering customer of users but now they're so common place same thing with one click shopping and so on but that's a compliment that's how you know you events something that's so used so beneficially used by so many people that they take it for granted I don't know about nobody I say every time when he's Amazon I'm still amazed how does this work the one so you're that that proves you're very curious explore all right all right back to the rocket timeline you said 2024 as a stands now are both the first test launch and the launch of the Escapade Explorers tomorrow is still possible in 2024 yeah I think so for sure the first launch and then we'll see if Escapade goes on that or not I think that the first launch for sure and I hope Escapade too I hope well I just don't know which mission it's it's actually going to be slated on so we also have other things that might go on that first mission oh I got it but you're optimistic that the launch is the first launch I'm very optimistic that the first launch of new Glenn will be in 2024 and I'm just not 100% certain what payload will be on that first launch you nervous about it are you kidding I'm extremely nervous about it 100% I have you know every every launch I go to you know for new shepherd for other vehicles too I'm always nervous for these launches but yes for sure a first launch to have no nervous is about that would be you know some sign of derangement I think so well I get to visit the launch but it's pretty I mean that pay you know we have done a tremendous amount of ground testing a tremendous amount of simulation so you know a lot of the problems that we might find in flight have been resolved but there are some problems you can only find in flight so you know cross your fingers I guarantee you you'll you'll have fun watching it and I know what happens 100% when the thing is fully assembled it comes up yeah the the the the the a a a a a a a just a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a You know, comes up over a few hours. You know, yeah, it's a beautiful thing to watch. Uh, speaking of which, if that makes you nervous, I don't know if you remember. But you, uh, wore a board, uh, new shepherd, and it's first crude flight. Uh, how was that experience? Were you, were you terrified then? You know, strangely, I wasn't, you know, I ride the rocket. Let's never, I've watched other people ride in the rocket. And I'm more nervous than when I was inside the rocket myself. Um, it was a difficult conversation to have with my mother. Uh, when I told her I was going to go on the first one. And not only was I going to go, but I was going to bring my brother to this. The tough conversation to have with a mom. And there's a long pause. I thought, just like both of you. Um, and it was, an incredible experience. And we were, we were laughing inside the capsule. And, you know, we're not nervous. Um, to people on the ground, we're very nervous for us. Um, and it was actually one of the most emotionally powerful parts of the experience was not, happened even before the flight at 430 in the morning. Brother and I are getting ready to go to the launch site and Lauren is going to take a star and her helicopter and we're getting ready to leave. We go outside outside the ranch house there in West Texas or the launch facility is and all of our family, my kids and my brothers, kids and our, you know, our, our, the parents and, uh, close friends are assembled there. And they're saying goodbye to us, but they're kind of saying maybe they think they're saying goodbye to us forever. And, you know, we might not have felt that way, but it was obvious from their faces how nervous they were that they felt that way. And it was sort of powerful because it allowed us to see almost like attending your home, a moral service or something like you could feel how loved you were in that moment. Um, and it was, uh, it was really amazing. Yeah, and then there's just the epic nature to it too. The assent floating in zero gravity, I'll tell you something very interesting. Zero gravity feels very natural. I don't know if it's because we, you know, it's like return to the world or what you're an alien, but I think that's what we just said. You'll so natural to be in zero. It was really interesting. And then what people talk about the overview of fact and seeing Earth from space, I had that feeling very powerful. I think everyone did, um, you see how fragile the Earth is. If you're not an environmentalist, it will make you one. Uh, the great Jim level quote, you know, he looked back at the Earth from space. And he said he realized you don't go to heaven when you die. You go to heaven when you're born. And it's just, you know, that's the feeling that people get when they're in space. You see all this blackness, all this nothingness, and there's one gem of life and it's Earth. It is a gem. Uh, what, you know, you're, you've talked a lot about decision making throughout your time with Amazon. What was that decision like to, uh, to write to be the first, to write in your shepherd? Like what just before you talk to your mom? Yeah. What, what, like what the pros and cons, like actually as one human being as a as a leader of a company, um, on all fronts, like what was that decision making like, I decided that first of all, I knew the vehicle extremely well. I know the team who built it, I know the vehicle. Um, the, uh, I'm very comfortable with the, like the escape system. We put as much effort into the escape system on that vehicle as we put into all the rest of the vehicle combined. It's one of the hardest pieces of engineering in the entire new shepherd architecture. Can you just describe what do you mean by escape system? What's evolved? We have a solid rocket motor in the base of the crew capsule. So that if anything goes wrong on ascent, you know, while the main rocket engines firing, we can ignite this solid rocket motor in the base of the crew capsule and escape from the booster. It's a very challenging system to build, design, validate, test, all these things. It is the reason that I am controlling anyone go on new shepherd. So the, the booster is this safe and reliable as we can make it. But, um, we are harnessing whenever you're talking about rocket engines. I don't care what rocket is you're talking about. You are harnessing such vast power in such a small compact geometric space. The power density is so enormous that it is impossible to ever be sure that nothing will go wrong. And so the only way to improve safety is to have an escape system. And you know, historically rockets, human-rated rockets have had escape systems. Only the space shuttle did not. And, um, but Apollo had one, you know, all of the previous, you know, Jim and I, etc., they all had escape systems. And, uh, we have on new shepherd, on usual escape, most escape systems are towers. We have a pusher escape system. So the solder locomotor is actually embedded in the base of the crew capsule and it pushes. And it's reusable in the sense that if we don't use it. So if we have a nominal mission, we land with it. The tower systems have to be ejected at a certain point in the mission. And so they get wasted even in a nominal mission. And so again, you know, cost really matters on these things. So we figured out how to have the escape system be a reusable, uh, in the event that it's not used. You can reuse it, um, and have it be a pusher system. It's a very sophisticated thing. So I knew these things. You asked me about my decision to go. And so I know the vehicle very well. I know the people who designed it. I have great trust in them, um, and in the engineering that we did. And I thought to myself, look, if I am not ready to go, then I wouldn't want anyone to go. A tourism vehicle has to be designed in my view to have very to be as safe as one can make it. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, you can't make it perfectly safe. It's impossible. But, you know, you just have to, you know, people will do think people take risk, you know, they climb mountains, they, you know, they skydive, they, you know, to deep underwater scuba diving and so on. People are okay taking risk. You can't eliminate the risk. But it is something because it's a tourism vehicle. You have to do your utmost to eliminate those risks. And I felt very good about the system. I think it's one of the reasons I was so calm. Insighted. If you others were to scoff, they didn't know as much about it as I did. What was in charge of engaging the escape systems, you have. It's automated. Okay. The escape system is visualizing. It's like it's completely automated. Automated is better because it can react so much faster. So yeah, for tourism rockets, safety is a huge huge, huge, huge priority for space exploration. Also, but a little, a tiny, you know, Delta less. Yeah, so I mean, I think for, you know, if you're doing, you know, there are human activities where we tolerate more risk. If you're saving somebody's life, you know, if you are, you know, engaging in real exploration, um, these are things where, you know, I personally think you, we would accept more risk in part because you have to. Is there a part of you that's frustrated by the rate of progress in Blue Origin? Blue Origin needs to be much faster. And it's one of the reasons that I left my roles, the CEO of Amazon a couple of years ago. I needed, I wanted to come in and, um, Blue Origin needs me right now. And so I had always, when I was the CEO of Amazon, my point of view on this is, if I'm the CEO of a publicly-traded company, it's going to get my full attention. And I really, just how I think about things, it was very important to me. I felt I had an obligation to all the stakeholders to Amazon to do that. And so having, you know, turned the CEO, I was still the executive chair there, but I've turned the CEO role over. And the reason, the primary reason I did that is that I could spend time of Lourge and adding some, you know, energy, some sense of urgency, we need to move much faster. And we're going to. What are the ways to speed it up? So I mean, there's, uh, you've talked a lot of different ways to sort of, uh, an Amazon, um, you know, removing barriers for, for progress or distributing, making everybody autonomous and stuff for lying in terms, although all those kinds of things, is that apply at Blue Origin or does apply? I know, I'm leading this directly. We are going to become the world's most decisive company across any industry. And so, you know, at Amazon, for, you know, ever since the beginning, as we're going to come, the world's most customer obsessed company. And no matter the industry, like, people one day people are going to come to Amazon from the health care industry and want to know, how did you guys, how are you, how are you so customer obsessed? How do you act, not just pay lip service that but actually do that. Um, and from, you know, all different industries should come on a study us to see how we accomplish that. And the analogous thing of Blue Origin and we'll help us move faster is we're going to become the world's most decisive company. We're going to get really good at taking appropriate technology risk, making those decisions quickly, you know, being bold on those things. That's what, and having the right culture that supports that, you need people to be ambitious, technically ambitious. You know, if there are five ways to do something, we'll study them. But let's study them very quickly and make a decision. We can always change our mind. It doesn't, you know, changing your mind. I took about one way doors and two way doors. Most decisions are two way doors. Can you explain that because I love that metaphor? If you make the wrong decision, if it's a two way door decision, you walk out the door, you pick a door, you walk out. You spend a little time there. It turns out to be the wrong decision, come back in and pick another door. Some decisions are so consequential and so important and so hard to reverse that they really are one way door decisions. You go in that door, you're not coming back. And those decisions have to be made very deliberately, very carefully. If you can think of yet another way to analyze the decision, you should slow down and do that. So, you know, when I see your avams on, I often found myself in the position of being the chief slow down officer, because somebody would be bringing me a one way door decision. I was okay. I can think of three more ways to analyze that. So, let's go do that because we are not going to be able to reverse this one easily. Maybe you can reverse if it's going to be very costly and very time consuming. We really have to get this one right from the beginning. And what happens, unfortunately, in companies where can happen, is that you have a one size fits all decision making process, where you're in a using the heavyweight process on all decisions. Including the lightweight ones, the two-way door decisions. Two-way door decisions should must be made by single individuals or by very small teams deep in the organization. And one-way door decisions are the ones that are the your first ones. Those are the ones that should be elevated up to, you know, the seniormost executives who should slow them down and make sure that the right thing is being done. Yeah, I mean, part of the skill here is to do know the difference in one way and two-way. I think you must, yes. I mean, I think you mentioned Amazon Prime, the decision to sort of create Amazon Prime as a one-way door. I mean, it's not clear if it is or not, but it probably is, and it's a really big risk to go there. There are a bunch of decisions like that that are, you know, changing the decision is going to be very, very complicated. Some of them are technical decisions too, because some technical decisions are like quick drying cement. You know, if you're going to once you make them, it gets really hard to be choosing which propellants to use in a vehicle, selecting LNG for the booster stage and selecting hydrogen for the upper stage. That has turned out to be a very good decision, but if you change your mind, that would be a very big setback. Do you see what I was saying? Yeah. So that's the kind of decision you scrutinize very, very carefully. Other things just aren't like that. Most decisions are not that way. Most decisions should be made by single individuals, but they need and done quickly in the full understanding that you can always change your mind. Yeah. One of the things I really liked, perhaps it's not too way-door decisions, I disagree and commit phrase. So don't, so somebody brings up an idea to you if the two-way door, you state that you don't understand enough to agree. You still back them. I'd love to. Very good to explain that. Yes, disagree and commit is a really important principle that saves a lot of arguing. Yeah. So what do you use them at personal level? I disagree. But, come in. It's very common in any endeavor in life and business and anybody where you have teammates, you have a teammate and the two of you disagree. Yeah. At some point you have to make a decision. And companies we tend to organize hierarchically. So whoever is the more senior person, ultimately gets to make the decision. So ultimately the CEO gets to make that decision. And the CEO may not always make the decision that they agree with. So I would often, I would be the one who would disagree and commit. Some one of my director posts would very much want to do something in a particular way. I would think it was a bad idea. I would explain my point of view. They would say, I, Jeff, I think, you're wrong. And here's why. And we would go back and forth. And I would often see, you know what? I don't think you're right. But I'm going to gamble with you. And you're closer to the ground truth than I am. I had known you for 20 years. You have great judgment. I don't know that I'm right either, not really not for sure. All these decisions are complicated. Let's do it your way. But at least then you've made a decision. And I'm agreeing to commit to that decision. So I'm not going to be second guessing it. I'm not going to be sniping at it. I'm not going to be saying I told you so I'm going to try actively to help make sure it works. That's a really important teammate behavior. There's so many ways that dispute resolution is a really interesting thing on teams. And there are so many ways with two people disagree about something. Even I'm assuming like the case where everybody's well intentioned. They just have a very different opinion about what the right decision is. And we have in our society and inside companies we have a bunch of mechanisms that we use to resolve these kinds of disputes. A lot of them are I think really bad. So an example of a really bad way of coming to agreement is compromise. So compromise, you know, look, here's where it and room here and I could say, Lex, how tall do you think this ceiling is? And you'd be like, I don't know Jeff, maybe 12 feet tall. And I would say, I think it's 11 feet tall. And then would you know what? Let's just call it 11 and a half feet. That's compromise. Instead of the right thing to do is you know to go to tape measure or figure out some way of actually measuring. But think getting that tape measure and figure out how to get it to the top of the ceiling and all these things. That requires energy. Compromise the advantage of compromise as a resolution mechanism is that it's low energy. But it doesn't lead to truth. And so in things like the height of the ceiling where truth is a noble thing, you shouldn't allow compromise to be used when you can know the truth. Another really bad resolution mechanism that happens all the time is just who's more stubborn. Yeah, this is also let's say two executives who disagree and they just have a war of attrition and whichever one gets exhausted first capitulates to the other one. Again, you haven't arrived at truth and this is very demoralizing. So you know this is where escalation I try to ask people who you know on my team, it's a never get to a point where you are resolving something by who gets exhausted first. escalate that. I'll help you make the decision. Really, let's because that's so deenergizing as such a terrible, lousy way to make a decision. Do you want to get to the resolution as quickly as possible because that ultimately leads to high velocity of this? Yes, and you want to try to get as close to truth as possible. So you want like exhausting the other person is not truth-seeking. Yes. And compromise is not truth-seeking. So you know it doesn't mean no and there are a lot of cases where no one knows the real truth and that's where disagree and commit can come in. But it's escalation is better than more of a tradition. Escalate just you know to your boss and say hey we can't agree on this. We like each other. We're respectful of each other but we strongly disagree with each other. We need you to you know make a decision here so we can move forward. But decisiveness moving forward quickly on on decisions as quickly as you responsibly can is how you increase velocity. Most of what slows things down is taking too long to make decisions at all scale levels. You know so it has to be part of the culture to get high velocity. You know Amazon has a million and a half people and the company is still fast. We're still decisive we're still quick. And that's because the culture supports that. At every scale in a distributed way. Yeah, maximize the velocity of decisions. Exactly. You mentioned the lunar program. Let me ask you about that. Yeah. There's a lot going on there and you haven't really talked about it much. So in addition to the Artemis program with NASA, Blue is doing its own lander program. Can you describe it? There's a sexy picture on Instagram with one of them. Is it them K1 I guess? Yeah the Mark one. The picture is me with Bill Nelson, the NASA administrator. Just to clarify the landers the sexy thing about things. I know it's not me. I know it's either lander or Bill. I like Bill but the Mark one lander is designed to take 3,000 kilograms to the surfaces of the Moon and cargo expendable cargo. It's an expendable lander. Lans on the Moon stays there. Take 3,000 kilograms to the surface. It can be launched on a single new Glenn flight which is very important. So it's a relatively simple architecture. Just like the human landing system lander, the called the Mark II, Mark one is also fueled with liquid hydrogen and which is for high energy missions like landing on the surface of the Moon. The high-specific impulse of hydrogen is a very big advantage. The disadvantage of hydrogen has always been that it's such a deep cryogen. It's not storeable. So it's constantly boiling off and you're losing propellant because it's boiling off. And so what we're doing is part of our lunar program is developing solar powered cryocoolers that can actually make hydrogen a storeable propellant for deep space. That's a real game changer. It's a game changer for any high energy mission. So to the Moon but to the outer planets to Mars everywhere. So the idea with Mark one, both Mark one and Mark two is the new Glenn can carry it from the surface of Earth to the surface of the Moon. Exactly. So the Mark one is expendable. The lunar lander we're developing for NASA, the Mark II lander. That's part of the Artemisburg they call it the sustaining lander program. So that lander is designed to be reusable. It can land on the surface of the Moon in a single stage configuration and then take off. So the whole, you know, he look at the Apollo program. The lunar lander in Apollo was really two stages. It would land on the surface and then it would leave the descent stage on the surface of the Moon. And only the Ascent stage would go back up into lunar orbit where it would run to view with the command module. Here what we're doing is we have a single stage lunar lander that carries down enough propellants that can bring the whole thing back up so that it can be reused over and over. And the point of doing that of course is to reduce cost so that you can make lunar missions more affordable over time. Which is, that's one of NASA's big objectives because this time, the whole point of Artemis is go back to the Moon but this time to stay. So, you know, back in the Apollo program we went to the Moon six times and then into the program and it really was too expensive to to continue. And so there's a few questions there but one is how do you stand the Moon? What ideas do you have about? Yeah, it's like a sustained and a sustaining life where a few folks can stay there for prolonged periods of time. Well, one of the things we're working on is using lunar resources like lunar regolith to manufacture commodities and even solar cells on the surface of the Moon. We've already built a solar cell that is completely made from lunar regolith simulant and this solar cell is only about 7% power efficient so it's very inefficient compared to, you know, the more advanced solar cells that we make here on Earth. But if you can figure out how to make a practical solar cell factory that you can land on the surface of the Moon and then the raw material for those solar cells is simply lunar regolith then you can just, you know, continue to turn out solar cells on the surface of the Moon. Have lots of power on the surface of the Moon. That will make it easier for people to live on the Moon. Similarly, we're working on extracting oxygen from lunar regolith. So lunar regolith by weight has a lot of oxygen in it. It's bound very tightly, you know, and as oxides with other elements and so you have to separate the oxygen which is very energy intensive. So that also could work together with the solar cells. But if you can and then ultimately we may be able to find practical quantities of ice in the permanently shadowed craters on the poles of the Moon. And we know there is ice water in those water ice in those craters and we know that we can break that down with electrolysis into hydrogen and oxygen and then you'd not only have oxygen but you'd also have a very good high efficiency propellant fuel in hydrogen. So there's a lot we can do to make the Moon more sustainable over time. But the very first step, the thing that kind of gate that all of that has to go through is we need to be able to land cargo and humans on the surface of the Moon at an acceptable cost. To fast forward a little bit, is there any chance Jeff Bezos steps foot on the Moon and on Mars? One or the other or both? It's very unlikely. I think it's probably something that gets done by future generations but the time it gets to me. I think in my lifetime that's probably going to be done by professional astronauts. Sadly, I would love to stand out for that mission. So don't count me out yet, Lex. Give me a few things shot here. Maybe. But I think if we are placing reasonable bets on such a thing in my lifetime, that will continue to be done by professional astronauts. Yes, these are risky, difficult missions. And probably missions that require a lot of training. You are going there for a very specific purpose to do something. We're going to be able to do a lot on the Moon too with automation. In terms of setting up these factories and doing all that, we're sophisticated enough now with automation and we probably don't need humans to tin those factories and machines. There's a lot that's going to be done in both modes. To ask the bigger picture question about the two companies pushing humanity forward out towards the stars, the origin and space X. Are you competitors, collaborators? Which in to what to go? Well, I would say, you know, just like the internet is big and there are lots of winners at all skill levels. I mean, there are half a dozen giant companies. The, you know, the internet has made, but there are a bunch of medium sized companies and a bunch of small companies all successful all with profit streams, all driving great customer experiences. That's what we want to see in space. That kind of dynamism and space is big. There's room for a bunch of winners and it's going to happen in all skill levels. And so, you know, space X is going to be successful for sure. I want a large and to be successful. And I hope there are another, you know, five companies right behind us. But, you know, I spoke to Elon a few times recently about you, about Blue Origin. And he was very positive about you as a person and very supportive of all the efforts you've been leading at Blue. What's your thoughts? You worked with a lot of leaders at Amazon at Blue. What's your thoughts about Elon as a human being and the leader? Well, I don't really know Elon very well. You know, I know his public persona, but I also know you can't know anyone by their public persona. It's impossible. I mean, you may think you do, but I guarantee you don't. So I don't really know you know Elon way better than I do, Lex. But in terms of his judging by the results, he must be a very capable leader. There's no way you could have, you know, Tesla and SpaceX without being a capable leader. It's impossible. Hey, I just, I hope you guys hang out sometimes. Shake hands and sort of have a kind of friendship that would inspire just the entirety of humanity. Because what you're doing is like one of the big grand challenges ahead of humanity. Well, I agree with you. And I think in a lot of these endeavors, we're very like-minded. Yeah. So I think, you know, I'm not saying we're identical, but I think we're very like-minded. And so, I, you know, I love that idea. I go back to sexy pictures on your Instagram. There's a video of you from the early days of Amazon giving a tour of your quote, sort of, offices. I think your dad is holding the camera. He is. Yeah, I know, I guess. This is what giant orange extension cord. Yeah. And you're like explaining the genius of the extension cord. And how does the desk and the CRT monitor? And sort of that's where the, that's where all the magic happened. I forget what your dad said, but this is like the center of it all. So, what was it like? What's going to your mind at that time? You left a good job in New York and took this leap. Were you excited? Were you scared? Well, excited. And scared. Anxious, you know, thought the odds is successful, low. It told all of our early investors that I thought there was a 30% chance of success. I mean, by which I just been getting your money back, not like turning on what actually happened. Because that's the truth. Every startup company is unlikely to work. It's helpful to be in reality about that. But that doesn't mean you can't be optimistic. So, you kind of have to have this duality in your head. Like on the one hand, you're, you know what the baseline statistics say about startup companies. And the other hand, you have to ignore all of that and just be 100% sure it's going to work. And you're doing both things the same time. You're holding that contradiction in your head. But it was so, so exciting. I love, you know, every from 1994 when the company was founded in 1995 when we opened our doors all the way until today. I find Amazon so exciting. And that doesn't mean it's like full of pain, full of problems. You know, it's like there's so many things that need to be resolved and worked and made better and etc. But on balance, it's so fun. It's such a privilege. It's been such a joy. I feel so grateful that I've been part of that journey. It's just been incredible. So, sometimes you don't want a single day of comfort. You've written about this many times. We'll talk about your writing, which I would highly recommend people read and just the letters to shareholders. So, you wrote a explaining the idea of day one thinking, I think you first wrote about in 97 letters to shareholders. Then you also, in a way, wrote about sad to say is that your last letter to shareholders is CEO. And you said that day two is stasis, followed by irrelevance, followed by excruciating painful decline, followed by death. And that is why it's always day one. Can you explain this day one thing? This is a really powerful way to describe the beginning in the journey of Amazon. It's really a very simple and I think age-old idea about renewal and rebirth. And like every day is day one. Every day you're deciding what you're going to do. And you are not trapped by what you were or who you were or any self-consistency. Self-consistency even can be a trap. And so day one thinking is kind of restart fresh every day. And we get to make new decisions every day about invention, about customers, about how we're going to operate what or even even as deeply as what our principles are. We can go back to that. Turns out we don't change those very often but we change them occasionally. And when we work on programs at Amazon, we often make a list of tenants. And the tenants are kind of, they're not principles. They're a little more tactical than principles but it's kind of the main ideas that we want this program to embody whatever those are. And one of the things that we do is we put these are the tenants for this program and the apprentices we always put unless you know a better way. And that idea unless you know a better way is so important because you never want to get trapped by dogma. You never want to get trapped by history. It doesn't mean you discard history or ignore it. There's so much value in what has worked in the past. But you can't be blindly following what you've done. And that's the heart of day one. There's your always starting fresh. And to the question of how to fend off day two you said such a question can't have a simple answer as you're saying. There will be many elements multiple paths and many traps. I don't know the whole answer but I may know bits of it. Here's a starter pack of essentials. Maybe others come to mind for day one defense. Customer obsession, a skeptical view of proxies, the eager adoption of external trends and high velocity decision making. So we talked about high velocity decision making. That's more difficult than the sounds. So maybe you can pick one that stands out to you as you can comment on. Egor adoption of external trends, high velocity decision making, skeptical view of proxies, high-deified off day two. Well, you know I'll talk about because I think it's the one that is maybe in some ways the hardest understand is the skeptical view of proxies. One of the things that happens in business probably anything that you're where you have an ongoing program and something is underway for a number of years is you develop certain things that you're managing to like let's say the typical case would be a metric. And that metric isn't the real underlying thing. And so maybe the metric is efficiency metric around customer contacts per unit sold or something like if you sell a million units how many customer contacts do you get or how many returns do you get and so on and so on. And so what happens is a little bit of a kind of inertia sets in where somebody a long time ago invented that metric and they invented that metric. They decided we needed to watch for you know customer returns per unit sold as an important metric but they had a reason why they chose that metric. The person who invented that metric and decided it was worth watching and then fast forward five years that metric is the proxy proxie for truth. The proxy for truth, the proxy for custody say in this case is a proxy for customer happiness. And but that metric is not actually customer happiness. It's a proxy for customer happiness. The person who invented the metric understood that connection five years later, it kind of inertia can set in and you forget the truth behind why you were watching that metric in the first place and the world shifts a little and now that proxy isn't as valuable as it used to be or it's missing something and you have to be on alert for that. You have to know okay this is I don't really care about this metric. I care about customer happiness and this metric is worth putting energy into and following and improving scrutinizing only in so much as it actually affects customer happiness. And so you got a constant of young guard and it's very very common. This is a nuanced problem. It's a very common, especially in large companies that they are managing to metrics that they don't really understand. They don't really know why they exist and the world may have shifted off from under them a little. And the metrics are no longer as relevant as they were when somebody ten years earlier invented the metric. That is a nuanced but that's a big problem right? It's not something so compelling to have a nice metric to try to optimize. Yes. And by the way you do need metrics. You can't ignore them. You want them but you just have to be constantly on guard. This is a way to slip into day two thinking would be to manage your business to metrics that you don't really understand and you're not really sure why they were invented in the first place and you're not sure they're still as relevant as they used to be. What does it take to be the guy or gal who who brings up the point that this proxy might be outdated? I guess what does it take to have a culture that enables them the meeting? Because that's a very uncomfortable thing to bring up what I'm meeting. We all should like this is a Friday. This is such you have just asked a million dollar question. So this is what you're if I generalize what you're asking you're talking in general about truth telling. And we humans are not really truth-seeking animals. We are social animals. Yeah, we are. And you know, take you back in time ten thousand years and you're in a small village. If you go along to get along, you can survive. You can procreate. If you're the village truth-teller, you might get clubbed to death in the middle of the night. Truths are often, they don't want to be heard. Because important truths can be uncomfortable. They can be awkward. They can be exhausting. Impolite. Yes. That's kind of challenging. They can make people defensive even if that's not the intent. But any high-performing organization, whether it's a sports team, a business, you know, a political organization, an activist group, I don't care what it is. Any high-performing organization has to have mechanisms and a culture that supports truth telling. One of the things you have to do is you have to talk about that. You have to talk about the fact that it takes energy to do that. You have to talk to people. You have to remind people it's okay that it's uncomfortable. You have to literally tell people it's not what we're designed to do as humans. It's not really, it's kind of a side effect. You know, we can do that. But it's not how we survive. We mostly survive by being social animals and being cordial and cooperative. That's really important. There's a science that's all about truth telling. It's actually a very formal mechanism for trying to tell the truth. Even in science, you find that it's hard to tell the truth. You're supposed to have hypothesis, test it, find data and reject the hypothesis and so on. It's not easy. But even in science, there's like the senior scientists and the junior scientists and then there's a hierarchy of humans where there's a loss of seniority, some have seniority matters in the scientific process, which is just a common. And that's true inside companies too. And so you want to set up your culture so that the most junior person can overrule the most senior person if they have data. And and that really is about trying to, you know, there are little things you can do. So for example, in every meeting that I attend, I always speak last. And I know from experience that, you know, if I speak first, even very strong-willed, highly intelligent, high judgment participants of that meeting will wonder, well, if Jeff thinks that I came in this meeting thinking one thing, but maybe I'm not right. And so you can do little things like if you're the most senior person in the room, go last. But everybody else go first. In fact, ideally, it's trying to have the most junior person go first in the second and try to go in order of seniority. So that you can hear everyone's opinion in the kind of unfiltered way. Because we really did, we actually literally change our opinions. If somebody who you really respect says something, makes you change your mind a little. So you're saying implicitly or explicitly give permission for people to have a strong opinion that as long as it's backed by data. Yes, and sometimes it can even, by the way, a lot of our most powerful truths turn out to be hunches. They turn out to be based on anecdotes. They're intuition-based. And sometimes you don't even have strong data. But you may know the personal enough to trust their judgment. You may feel yourself leaning in. It may resonate with the set of anecdotes you have. And then you may be able to say, you know, something about that feels right. Let's go collect some data on that. Let's try to see if we can actually know whether it's right. But for now, let's not disregard it because it feels right. You can also fight inherent bias. There's an optimism bias. Like if there are two interpretations of a new set of data. And one of them is happy. And one of them is unhappy. It's a little dangerous to jump to the conclusion that the happy interpretation is right. You may want to sort of compensate for that human bias of looking for, you know, trying to find the silver lining. And so look, that might be good. But I'm going to go with it's bad for now until we're sure. So speaking of happiness bias, data collection, and anecdotes, you have to, how's that for transition? You have to, you have to tell me the story of the call you made, the customer service call you made to demonstrate a point about wait times. Yeah, this is very early in the history of Amazon. And we were going over a weekly business review in a set of documents. And I have, I have a saying, which is when the data and the anecdotes disagree, the anecdotes are usually right. And it doesn't mean you just say, obviously, go fall, the anecdotes then. It means you go examine the data. And it's usually not the data is being miscollected. It's usually that you're not measuring the right thing. And so, you know, if you have a bunch of customers complaining about something. And at the same time, you know, your metrics look like why they shouldn't be complaining. You should doubt the metrics. And an early example of this was we had metrics that showed that our customers were waiting, I think, less than, I don't know, 60 seconds. When they called it 1-800 number to get, you know, phone customer service, the wait time was supposed to be less than 60 seconds. And but we had a lot of complaints that it was longer than that. And anecdotally, it seemed longer than that, like, you know, I would call customer service myself. And so, one day, we're in a meeting or going to the WBR and the weekly business review, we get to this metric in the deck. And the guy who leads customer service is to fit in the metric. And I said, okay, let's call. Picked up the phone. And I dialed the 100 number and called customer service. And we just waited in silence for the first time. What is it turned out to be? Oh, it was really long, more than 10 minutes, I think. Oh, wow. I mean, it was many minutes. And so, you know, it dramatically made the point that something was wrong with the data collection. We weren't measuring the right thing. And that, you know, set off a whole chain of events where we started measuring it right. And that's an example by the way of truth telling is like, that's an uncomfortable thing to do. But it's, but you have to seek truth, even when it's uncomfortable. And you have to get people's attention and they have to buy into it. And they have to get energized around really fixing things. So that speaks to the obsession with the customer experience. So one of the defining aspects of your approach to Amazon is just being obsessed with making customers happy. I think companies sometimes say that, but Amazon is really obsessed with that. And I think there's something really profound to that, which is seeing the world through the eyes of the customer, like the customer experience, the people being, that's using the product that's enjoying the product, they're like, what their, like the subtle little things that make up their experience, like how do you optimize those? This is another really good and kind of deep question because there are big things that are really important to manage. And then there are small things internally to Amazon. We call them paper cuts. So we have, we're always working on the big things. Like if you ask me, and most of the energy goes into the big things as it should. So and you can identify the big things and I would encourage anybody, if any, you know, but it listening to this is an entrepreneur, small business, whatever. You know, think about the things that are not going to change over 10 years. And those are probably the big things. So like I know in our retail business that I have is on 10 years from now customers are still going to out low prices. I know they're still going to want fast delivery and I just know they're still going to want big selection. So it's impossible to imagine a scenario where 10 years from now, I say, where customers, I love Amazon. I just wish the prices were a little higher. Or I love Amazon. I just wish you delivered a little more slowly. So when you identify the big things, you can tell their worth putting energy into because they're stable in time. Okay. But you're asking about something a little different, which is in every customer experience, there are those big things. And by the way, it's astonishingly hard to focus even on just the big things. So even though they're obvious, they're really hard to focus on. But in addition to that, there are all these little tiny customer experience deficiencies. And we call those paper cuts. And we make long lists of them. And then we have dedicated teams, the go fix paper cuts because the teams working on the big issues, never get to the paper cuts. They never work their way down the list to get to their work on big things as they should. And as you want them to. And so you need special teams who are charged with fixing paper cuts. Well, where would you put on the on the paper cuts spectrum, the buy now, the one click button, which is I think pretty genius. So to me, like, okay, my interaction with things I love on the internet. There's things I do a lot. I may be representing regular human. I would love for those things to be frictionless. For example, booking airline tickets, just saying. But, you know, buying a thing with one click, making that for experience frictionless, intuitive, all that's personal. Like that, that just fundamentally makes my life better. Not just in terms of efficiency, in terms of some kind of cognitive load. Yeah, cognitive load and peace, inner peace and happiness. But first of all, buying stuff is in a pleasant experience, having enough money to buy a thing. And then buying it is a pleasant experience. And like having pain around that is somehow just eruning a beautiful experience. And I guess, well, I'm saying as a person who loves good ideas, is that a paper cut, a solution to your paper cut? Yes. So it's probably that particular thing is probably a solution to a number of paper cuts. So if you go back and look at our order pipeline and how people shopped on Amazon, before we invented one click shopping, there was more friction, there was a whole series of paper cuts. And that invention eliminated a bunch of paper cuts. And I think you're absolutely right, by the way, that when you come up with something like one click shopping, again, this is like so ingrained in people now. I've impressed that you even noticed it. I mean, most of the time I clicked the button. I just never, surge of happiness. There is in the perfect invention for the perfect moment in the perfect context. There is real beauty. Yeah. It is actual beauty. It feels good. It's emotional. It's emotional for the inventor. It's emotional for the team that builds it. It's emotional for the customer. It's a big deal. And you can feel those things. But to keep coming up with that idea, with those kinds of ideas, I guess is the day one thinking effort. Yeah. And you need a big group of people who feel that kind of satisfaction with creating that kind of beauty. There's a lot of books written about you. There's a book invent and wander where Walter Isaacson doesn't intern. It's mostly collective writings of yours. I've read that. I also recommend people check out the Founder's podcast that covers you a lot and it does different analysis of the different business advice you've given over the years. I bring all that up because I saw that there, I mentioned that you said that books are an antidote for short attention spans. And I forget how it was phrased. But that when you were thinking about the Kindle, that you're thinking about how technology changes us. Yeah. We co-volve with our tools. So we invent new tools and then our tools change us. Which is fascinating to think about. Those are in a circle. And there's some aspect, you know, even just inside business, where you don't just make the customer happy, but you also have to think about like, where is this going to take humanity if you zoom out a bit. 100%. And, you know, you can feel your brain, brains are plastic. And you can feel your brain getting reprogrammed. I remember the first time this happened to me was when Tetris, who first came on the scene, I'm sure you've had anybody who's been a game player, how's this experience, where you close your eyes to lay down to go to sleep. And you see all the little blocks moving and you're kind of rotated them in your mind. And you're just tell, as you walk around the world, that you have rewired your brain to play Tetris. And but that happens with everything. And so, you know, one of the, I think, yeah, we still have yet to see the full repercussions of this, I fear. I think one of the things that we've done online, you know, largely because of social media is we have trained our brains to be really good at processing super short form content. And, you know, your podcast flies in the face of this, you know, you do these long format things. And reading books is a long format thing. And we all do more of, if something is convenient, we do more of it. And so when you make tools, you know, that we carry around a little, we carry around in our pocket, a phone. And one of the things that phone does for the most part is it is an attention shortening device. Because most of the things we do on our phone, shorten our attention spans. And I'm not even going to say we know for sure that does bad. But I do think it's happening. That's one of the ways we're co-volving with that tool. But I think, I think it's important to spend some of your time in some of your life to in long attention span things. Yeah, I think you've spoken about the value in your own life of focus. I've seen the focus on the thing for prolonged periods of time. And that's certainly what books do. And that's certainly what that piece of technology does. But I bring all that up to ask you about another piece of technology AI that has the potential to have a very trajectories to have an impact on human civilization. How do you think AI will change this? What if you're talking about, you know, generative AI, large language models, things like CHIGPT and it's soon successors. And these are incredibly powerful technologies to believe otherwise is to bear your head in the sand, soon to be even more powerful. It's interesting to me that large language models in their current form are not inventions, their discoveries. The telescope was an invention. But looking through it at Jupiter, knowing that it had moons was a discovery. My God, it has moons. And that's what Galileo did. And so this is closer on that spectrum of invention. We know exactly what happens with a 787. It's an engineered object. We designed it. We know how behaves. We don't want any surprises. Large language models are much more like discoveries. We're constantly getting surprised by their capabilities. They're not really engineered objects. Then you know, you have this debate about whether they're going to be good for human and your bad for humanity. Even specialized AI can be very bad for humanity. I mean, it's just regular machine learning models that can make certain weapons of war that could be incredibly destructive and very powerful. And they're not generally eyes. They're just, they're just be very smart weapons. And so we have to think about all of those things. I'm very optimistic about this. So even in the face of all this uncertainty, my own view is that these powerful tools are much more likely to help us and save us even than they are to on balance, hurt us and destroy us. We humans have a lot of ways of we can make ourselves go extinct. Help us not do that. So they may actually save us. So the people who are overly concerned, I mean, my view, overly concerned, is a valid debate. I think that they may be missing part of the equation, which is how helpful they could be in making sure we don't destroy ourselves. And if you saw the movie Oppenheimer, but to me, I first love the movie and I thought the best part of the movie is this bureaucrat played by Robert Downey Jr, who, you know, some of the people have talked to you, that's the most boring part of the movie. I thought it was the most fascinating because what's going on here is you realize we have invented this awesome, destructive, powerful technology is called nuclear weapons and they are managed and, you know, we humans we're not really capable of wielding those weapons. That's what he represented in that movie is, here's this guy who is just he wrongly thinks he's like being so petty, he thinks he said something that Oppenheimer said something bad to Einstein about him. They didn't talk about him at all as you find out in the final scene of the movie and yet he spent his career trying to be vengeful and petty and that's the problem. We as a species are not really sophisticated enough and mature enough to handle these technologies. And by the way, before you get to generally eye and the possibility of AI having agency and there's a lot of things that would have to happen but there's so much benefit that's going to come from these technologies in the meantime even before they're, you know, generally I in terms of better medicines and better tools to develop more technologies and so on. So I think it's an incredible moment to be alive and to witness the transformations that are going to happen how quickly will happen. No one knows but over the next 10 years and 20 years I think we're going to see really remarkable advances and I personally am very excited about it. First of all, really interesting to say that this discovery is that it's true that we don't know the limits of what's possible with the current language models. We don't. And like, it could be a few tricks and hacks here and there that that open doors to hold entire new possibilities. We do know that humans are doing something different from these models in part because you know we're so power efficient. You know the human brain does remarkable things and it does it on about 20 watts of power and you know the AI techniques we use today use many kilowatts of power to do equivalent tasks. So there's something interesting about the way the human brain does this and also we don't need as much data so you know like self-driving cars or they have to drive billions and billions of miles to try and to learn how to drive and you know your average 16 year old figures it out with many fewer miles. So there are still some tricks I think that we have yet to learn. I don't think we've learned the last trick. I don't think it's just a question of scaling things up. But what's interesting is that just scaling things up and I put just in quotes because it's actually hard to scale things up but just scaling things up also appears to pay huge dividends. Yeah and it's a there's some more nuanced aspect about human beings that's interesting to be able to accomplish like being truly original and novel to you know large language models being able to come up with some truly new ideas. That's one and the other one is truth. It seems that large language models are very good at sounding like they're saying a truth thing but they don't require or often have a grounding in sort of a mathematical truth. It can just basically is a very good bullshitter. So if there's not enough depth if there's not enough sort of data in the training data about a particular topic is just going to concoct accurate sounding narratives which is a very fascinating problem to try to solve. How do you get language models to infer what is true and not to sort of introspect? Yeah they need to be taught to say I don't know. I don't know more often. Yeah and I know several humans who could be taught that as well sure. And then the other stuff because you're still a bit involved in the Amazon side with the AI things the other open questions what kind of products are created from this? Oh so many. Yeah. I mean you know just to you know we have Alexa and Echo and Alexa has you know hundreds of millions of installed base you know inputs and so there's this there's you know there's Alexa everywhere and guess what Alexa is about to get a lot smarter. Yeah and so that's really you know from a product point of view that's super exciting. There's so many opportunities there. So many opportunities shopping assistant you know all that stuff is amazing. An AWS you know we're building Titan which is our foundational model we're also building bedrock which are corporate clients at AWS or enterprise clients they want to be able to use these powerful models with their own corporate data. Yes without accidentally contributing their corporate data to that model. Yes. And so those are the tools we're building for them with bedrock. So there's tremendous opportunity here. Yeah the security they probably see all those things are fascinating of how to there's so much value can be gained by training on private data but you want to keep the secure. This is a fast-paced technology. This is a very challenging technical problem and it's one that we're you know making progress on and dedicated solving for our customers. Do you think there will be a day when humans and robots maybe Alexa have a romantic relationship? Like it. Well I mean I think if you look at the story of the spectrum of human variety and what people like you know sexual variety. Yes you know there people who like everything so the answer to question has to be yes. I guess I'm not sure why it's spread out. But it will happen. I was just asking why to forefront but sorry. I was just moving on. Next question. What's a perfectly productive day in the life of Jeff Basis. Do you know one of the most productive humans in the world? Well first of all I get up in the worry and I putter. I like I like have a coffee. I like find putter. Just like I slowly move around. I'm not as productive as you might think I am. I mean I because I do believe in wandering and I sort of I you know I read my phone for a while. I read newspapers for a while. I chat with Laura and I drink my first coffee. So I kind of I move pretty slowly in the first cup of art. I get up early just naturally and and then you know I exercise most days and most days it's not the hard for me. So days it's really hard and I do it anyway. I don't want to you know and it's painful and I'm like why am I here and I don't want to do it. Why am I here at the gym? Why don't I do something else? It's not always easy. What's the social motivation in those moments? I know that I'll feel better later if I do it. And so like the real source of motivation I can tell the days when I skip it. I'm not quite as alert. It all feels good. And then there's harder motivation that's longer term. You want to be healthy as you age. You want health span. You want ideally you want to be healthy and moving around when you're 80 years old. You know and so there's a lot of but that kind of motivation is so far in the future. It can be very hard to work in the second. So thinking about the fact I'll feel better in about four hours if I do it now. I have more energy for the rest of my day and so on and so on. What's your exercise routine just to linger on that? What are you how much you curl? What are we talking about here? That's all I do at the gym side. I just I my routine on a good day. I do about half an hour of cardio and I do about 45 minutes of weight lifting. Resist is training of some kind mostly weights. I have a trainer who you know I love who pushes me which is really helpful. I'll be like I'll say Jeff you see you could we go up on that way a little bit and I'll think about it and I'll be like no I don't think so and he'll be he'll look at me and say yeah I think you can and of course he's right and so it's always to have somebody push you a little bit but almost every day you do that. I do almost every day I do a little bit of cardio and a little bit of weight lifting and I'd rotate I do a pulling day and a pushing day and a leg day it's all pretty standard stuff. So puttering coffee, jittering coffee, gym and then work. Or what's work look like what what are the productive hours look like for you? I you know so I a couple years ago I left as the CEO of Amazon and I have never worked harder in my life. I am working so hard and I mostly enjoying it but there are also some very painful days most of my time is spent on Blurgeon and I've been I'm so deeply involved here now for the last couple of years and in the big I love it and the small there's all the frustrations that come along with everything you know we're trying to get to rate manufacturing as we talked about that's super important we'll get there we just hire a new CEO guy I've known for close to 15 years now a guy named Dave Lemp who I love he's amazing you know so we're super lucky to have Dave and you know we're gonna you're gonna see us move faster there but so my Dave work you know reading documents have a meetings sometimes in person sometimes over zoom depends on where I am it's all about you know the technology it's about the organization it's about you know I'm very I have architecture and technology meetings almost every day on various subsystems inside the vehicle inside the engines it's super fun for me my favorite part of it is the technology my least favorite part of it is you know building organizations and so on that's important but it's also my least favorite part so you know that's why they call it work you don't know it's good to do what you want to do how do you achieve time where you can focus and truly think through problems I do little thinking retreats so for this is not the only I can do that all day long I'm very good at focusing I'm very good at you know I don't keep to a strict schedule like my meetings often go longer than I plan for them too because I believe in wandering I let my perfect meeting starts with a crisp document so the document should be written with such clarity that it's like angels singing from on high I like a crisp document and a messy meeting and so the meeting is about like asking questions that nobody knows the answer to and and and trying to like wander your way to a solution and and that is if when that happens just right it makes all the other meetings worthwhile it feels good it has it has a kind of beauty to it it has an aesthetic beauty to it and you get real breakthroughs and meetings like that can you actually describe the crisp document like this is one of the legendary aspects of Amazon of the way your approach meetings is the six page memo maybe first describe the process of a variety of meeting with memos and meetings at Amazon and the boards are unusual when we get new when new people come in like a new executive choice there are a little taken aback sometimes because the typical meeting will start with six page narratively structured memo and we do study hall for 30 minutes we sit there silently together in the meeting and read the notes and the margins and then we discuss and the reason by the way we do study you could say I would like everybody to read these memos and advance but the problem is people don't have time to do that and they end up coming to the meeting having only skimmed the memo or maybe not read it all and they're trying to catch up and also bluffing like they were in college having pretended to do the reading it's better just to carve out the time for people to do it so now all the same page we've all read the memo and now we can have a really elevated discussion and this is so much better from having a slideshow presentation you know a PowerPoint presentation of some kind where that has so many difficulties but one of the problems is PowerPoint is really designed to persuade it's kind of a sales tool and internally the last thing you want to do is sell you want it you're again you're truth-seeking you're trying to find truth and the other problem with PowerPoint is it's easy for the author and hard for the audience and a memo is the opposite it's hard to write a six page memo a good six page memo might take two weeks to write you have to write it you have to rewrite it you have to edit it you have to talk to people about it they have to poke holes in it for you you write it again it may take two weeks so the author it's a really very difficult job but for the audience it's much better so you can read a half hour and you know there are little problems with PowerPoint presentations too you know a senior executives interrupt with questions halfway through the presentation that questions gonna be answered on the next slide but you never got there was if you read the whole memo in advance you you know I often write lots of questions that I have in the margins of these memos and then I go cross them all out because by the time I get to the end of the memo they've been answered so I save all that time you also get you know if the person is preparing the memo we talked earlier about you know group think and you know the fact that I go last in meetings and that you don't want you know to your ideas to kind of pollute the meeting prematurely you know the author of the memo is is because kind of got to be very vulnerable they got to put all their thoughts out there and they've got to go first but that's great because it makes them really good and so and you get to see their real ideas and you're not trompling on them accidentally you're in a big you know PowerPoint presentation what's that feel like when you've authored a thing and then you're sitting there and everybody's reading your thing you're like I think it's mostly terrifying yeah like maybe in a good way I think it's terrifying I think it's terrifying in a productive way but I think it's mostly a very nerve-wracking experience is there art science to the writing of this six page memo or just writing in general to you the I mean it's really got to be a real memo so it means you know paragraphs have topic sentences the groups verbs and nouns you can't that's the other problem with part of my friends they're often just bullet points and you can you can hide a lot of sloppy thinking behind bullet points when you have to write in complete sentences with narrative structure it's really hard to hide sloppy thinking so it does it it forces the author to be at their best and so you're getting somebody's they're getting some is really their best thinking and then you don't have to spend a lot of time trying to tease that thinking out of the person you've got it from the very beginning so it really saves you time the long run so that part is crisp and then the rest is messy crisp yes so you don't want you don't want to pretend that the discussion should be crisp yeah there's you know most meanings you're trying to solve a really hard problem there's a different kind of meaning which we call weekly business reviews or weekly or monthly or daily whatever they are but these business review meanings that's usually for incremental improvement and you're looking at a series of metrics every time it's the same metrics so let's be needs to be very efficient they can start on time and in don't time so we're about to run out of time which is a good time to ask about the 10,000 year clock what is that as what I'm known for is the humor okay can you explain what the 10,000 here clock is. Pintaz your clock is a physical clock of monumental scale it's about 500 feet tall it's inside a mountain in west Texas in a chamber that's about 12 feet in diameter and 500 feet tall 10,000 year clock is a idea conceived by a brilliant guy named Danny Hillis way back in the 80s the idea is to build a clock as a symbol for long-term thinking and you can kind of just very conceptually think of the 10,000 year clock as it it you know it ticks once a year it chimes once you know every 100 years and the kuku comes out once every 1000 years so it just sort of slows everything down and it's a completely mechanical clock it is designed to last 10,000 years with no human intervention so the material choices and everything else it's in a remote location both to protect it but also so that visitors have to kind of make a pilgrimage the idea is that over time this will take hundreds of years but over time it will take on the patina of age and then it will become a symbol for long-term thinking that will actually hopefully get humans to extend their thinking horizons and my view that's really important as we have become as a species as a civilization more powerful you know we're really affecting the planet now we're really affecting each other we have weapons of mass destruction we have all kinds of things where we can really hurt ourselves and the problems we create can be so large you know the unintended consequences of some of reactions like climate change putting carbon the atmosphere is a perfect example that's an unintended consequence of the industrial revolution that a lot of benefits from it we've also got this side effect that is very detrimental we need to be who's hurt training ourselves to think longer term long-term thinking is a giant lever you can literally solve problems if you think long-term that are impossible to solve if you think short-term and we aren't really good at thinking long-term as you know it's not really you were kind of you know five years is a tough time frame for most institutions to think past and we probably need to stretch that to 10 years and 15 years and 20 years and 25 years and we do a better job for our children or our grandchildren if we could stretch those thinking horizons and so the clock is in a way it's an art project it's a symbol and if it ever has any power to influence people to think longer term that won't happen for hundreds of years but we have to you know we're going to build it now and let it accrue the patina of age do you think humans will be here when the clock runs out here on earth I think so but you know the United States won't exist like whole civilization's rise in about 10,000 years is so long like no nation's date has ever survived for anywhere close to 10,000 years and the increasing rate of progress makes that even even less likely so do I think humans will be here yes what you know how will we have changed our souls and what will we be and so on so on I don't know but I think we'll be here on that grand scale a human life feels tiny do you ponder your own mortality are you afraid of death no I'm you know I used to be afraid of death I did like my like I remember as a young person being kind of like very scared of mortality like you didn't want to think about it and so on and I always had a big and as I've gotten older I'm 59 now as I've gotten older somehow that fear has sort of gone away I don't you know I would like to stay alive for as long as possible but I'd like to be it's I'm really more focused on health span I want to be healthy I want that square wave I want to you know this is the healthy healthy and then God I want the long decay but and I'm curious I want to see how things turn out you know I'd like to be here I love my family and my close friends and I want to I'm curious about them and I want to see so I have a lot of reasons to stay around but it's mortality doesn't doesn't have that effect on me that it did you know maybe when I was in my 20s well Jeff thank you for creating Amazon one of the most incredible companies in history and thank you for trying your best to make humans a multiple and Terry species expanding out into our sources to maybe beyond to meet the aliens out there and thank you for talking today. Alex thank you for doing your part to link that our attention spans appreciate that very much. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jeff Bezos to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from Jeff Bezos himself be stubborn on vision but flexible on the details. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\""
